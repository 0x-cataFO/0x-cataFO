## 🌟 About Me
Hi there! I'm Osbert, a passionate self-taught developer who loves creating and exploring the endless possibilities of code. My journey has been one of curiosity and continuous learning, diving deep into:

- 🖥️ **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React  
- 🔍 **Backend:** Python Django, Go  
- 🔗 **Blockchain and DeFi Enthusiast**

When I'm not coding, you can find me gaming, researching new trends, or navigating the world of crypto and finances.
